# AI Data Analytics Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](public/dashboard-preview.png) *[Optional: Add screenshot]*

## Overview
A dynamic dashboard that simulates AI-powered natural language data analysis with mock data generation and interactive query capabilities.

## Key Features
- Real-time data visualization
- Simulated AI query interaction
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Redux-powered state management
- Mock data generation system

## Evaluation Focus

### React Component Structure
src/
├── components/
│ ├── QueryInput
│ ├── QueryHistory
│ ├── ResultsDisplay
| ├── SuggestionList
| ├── LoadingState
| ├── ErrorState
├── Store/
| ├── querySlice

├── Utils/
| ├── mockAI
| ├── mockDataGenerator


Components follow atomic design principles with clear separation of concerns. Smart containers manage data while presentational components handle rendering.

### State Management Efficiency
- **Redux Toolkit** for centralized state
- Normalized data structure for performance
- Async middleware for mock API calls

### UI/UX Design
- Inspired by modern analytics dashboards
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- Animated transitions for smooth interactions
- Accessible color scheme and contrast ratios
- Loading states for async operations

### Code Quality
- Type checking with PropTypes
- ESLint with React/JSX rules
- Prettier formatting
- Modular SCSS architecture
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Error boundary components

### Creativity in Simulating AI Interaction
- **MockAI Service**: Simulates NLP processing with:
  - Intent recognition
  - Entity extraction
  - Response generation
- **MockDataGenerator** provides:
  - Time-series trends
  - User segmentation
  - Statistical distributions
- Interactive query builder with:
  - Natural language input
  - Visual query preview
  - Historical query storage
