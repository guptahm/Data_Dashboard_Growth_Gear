## Overview
A dynamic dashboard that simulates AI-powered natural language data analysis with mock data generation and interactive query capabilities.

## Key Features
- Real-time data visualization
- Simulated AI query interaction
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Redux-powered state management
- Mock data generation system

### Key Components Breakdown

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **QueryInput** | Handles natural language queries with validation |
| **QueryHistory** | Handles and displays the past searched quereis |
| **ResultsDisplay** | Displays the mock Data from the fakerjs library |
| **SuggestionList** | Hard-coded lists with dynamic rendering like AI generated obtained using Promise and setTimeout |
| **Loading/Error State** | Loading and Error states |
| **mockAI** | Simulates NLP processing and intent recognition |
| **querySlice** | Manages query state and history |
| **mockDataGenerator** | Creates realistic analytics datasets |

### State Management Efficiency
- **Redux Toolkit** for centralized state
- Normalized data structure for performance
- Async middleware for mock API calls

### UI/UX Design
- Inspired by modern analytics dashboards
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- Animated transitions for smooth interactions
- Accessible color scheme and contrast ratios
- Loading states for async operations

### Code Quality
- Type checking with PropTypes
- ESLint with React/JSX rules
- Prettier formatting
- Modular SCSS architecture
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Error boundary components

### Creativity in Simulating AI Interaction
- **MockAI Service**: Simulates NLP processing with:
  - Intent recognition
  - Entity extraction
  - Response generation
- **MockDataGenerator** provides:
  - Time-series trends
  - User segmentation
  - Statistical distributions
- Interactive query builder with:
  - Natural language input
  - Visual query preview
  - Historical query storage
